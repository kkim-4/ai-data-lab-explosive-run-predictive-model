        "My code builds a stacked ensemble model to predict explosive football plays using both player tracking data and engineered contextual features. I start by loading and cleaning the raw NFL tracking data, converting key columns to numeric values, and handling missing data. Then, I engineer higher-level features, such as the rusher’s position, the nearest defender’s distance, score differential, and yards to goal, which capture spatial, situational, and contextual aspects of each play. I standardize numerical variables and one-hot encode categorical variables to create a transformed feature matrix ready for modeling. The target variable, `IsExplosive`, flags plays gaining 10 or more yards, framing the task as a binary classification problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "For modeling, I implement a stacked ensemble consisting of two base learners—a deep neural network (MLP) and an XGBoost classifier—trained using out-of-fold (OOF) predictions to improve robustness. These base models produce first-level features that I then feed into a meta-learner (a shallow XGBoost model), which learns how to optimally combine their outputs and captures any nonlinear interactions. I evaluate the final ensemble using an OOF ROC AUC score to assess predictive performance. Additionally, I include analysis to check whether a threshold of 150 carries per player is appropriate, using coverage metrics and AUC sensitivity plots to make sure the cutoff balances sufficient data inclusion with statistical stability.\n"
